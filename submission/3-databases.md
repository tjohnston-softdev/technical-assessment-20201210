# Chapter 3 - Databases

### Can you provide a brief description of the difference between a relational database (like Postgres) and a NoSQL database (like Mongo)

The main difference between relational and NoSQL databases is whether there is a schema involved. In other words, whether the database has a formal structure with strictly defined tables, columns, and rules as to how data is stored.

For example, in a MySQL relational database, data is grouped into specific tables with a specific set of columns for corresponding values. Each column has properties such as its name, data type, whether it is required, whether it must be unique, a default value, and so on. The data must strictly conform to the schema's rules. Otherwise, there may be errors. On the other hand, NoSQL has no formal rules (hence the name), and enables you to work more freely with unstructured data without a specific set of rules to follow.
