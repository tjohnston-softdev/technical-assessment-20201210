### What is the coolest project that you've worked on to date? Provide a short description of what it does, why it's cool, and what part you played in creating it.

I was directly commissioned by a start-up company in the recruitment industry to design and develop their information system. Up until that point, they were mostly paper-based with only a loose system of local spreadsheets and documents. The intention was to streamline their business processes and create an interactive client database for the general public.

For this project, we ended up using a Node JS backend and a MySQL database. The system was designed in such a way that it can be integrated into most websites without any hassle.
