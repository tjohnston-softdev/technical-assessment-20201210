# Technical Assessment (2020-12-10)

This is the submission for a technical assessment that I was invited to complete while applying for a software development role. The assessment was made up of short answer, code inspection, and command line questions. The code questions were written in Node JS with an Angular front-end. The theory questions were based on topics such as Git, database types, webpacks, and class inheritance, and unit testing.

If I remember correctly, the assessment was given via Google Forms. Therefore, I had to complete it all in one sitting. Fortunately, I was able to save my answers before submitting, which I am now sharing publicly.

The assessment was originally undertaken on 10 December 2020. The submission was converted to markdown on 27 October 2021 and shared publicly on 3 November 2021.
